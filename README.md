# RRTstar-TEB
This is my code for my Bachelors Thesis. Simulation and comparison of various path planing algorithms for autonomous vehicle. 

It implements RRT* as a global planner with TEB local planner. ROS navigation stack is used extensively. There is also a comparison study between RRT and RRT*. 



Feel free to use it just don't copy it as it as. This was uploaded for easy sharing between the project people and not for general public and hence it is not well commented. I will comment it as soon as I get time. 
Till then Cheers!!!
